# Decentralized-cloud-storage

### Rules:
1. Don't commit on master branch


### Development option:
* Set up the Repository in VSCode for better co-ordination
* Use venv/Scripts/activate before running code
* Intall libraries in venv only when it is active . Example: (venv) PS F:\Tanish\python\Decentralized cloud storage>
* If venv/Scripts/activate is giving error, try running Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process in terminal
